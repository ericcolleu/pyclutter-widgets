"""pyclut is an open source software library for creating rich animated 3D user
interfaces.
The goal of pyclut is not to provide a complete environment (GTK is better for that),
but to give some help for creating rich UI.
So in pyclut you will find:
   - basics shapes (like RoundRectangle, Start, Triangle)
   - controls like button (different styles), virtual keyboard, scrollable area, ...
   - menus (carrousel, coverflow, thumbnail wall, ...)
   - effects and transitions
   - and (of course with clutter) animations
